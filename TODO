TODO

- Launch window -> synodic periods

- Add trajectories for escaping and entering bodies

- Improve mass formatting (fmtmass) - small masses as engineering (g, mg, ug),
  larger masses as tons, very large masses as M(Earth), M(Jupiter) and
  M(Sun)

- Improve aliasing (especially fuel & engine aliasing)

- Ease mission setup: Now there is a need to make temporary orbits,
  these could be done internally.

- There is maybe need for system, in which you can choose if you want
  to use scalar or vector velocities. Vector velocities are bit difficult
  to use, as you need to match the directions. In basic scenarios, scalar
  velocities would be enough.

DONE:

- DONE: Add periapsis argument and time to ease up matching velocity vectors.
  This is made so, that when orbit has initial and final distances, you
  can enter the time and angle of the initial distance.

- DONE: Add "engine lab": This "lab" would have all sorts of useful equations
  to build different engines: chemical engines, ion thrusters, nuclear
  engines, antimatter infused fusion engines and so on. The designed
  engine parameters are then returned as Engine class, which can be
  attached to rockets.
